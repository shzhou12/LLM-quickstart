The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

My fianc\\u00e9 and I asked around - maybe it was in the lost and found? 2 people didn't even know they had a lost and found, 2 more ladies called down there and they said they would call back. After 30 minutes of waiting for them to call back, a lady took us to security who told us to go to lost and found. We went to lost and found and they took us to another lady and told them to call down. After being there for an hour and fifteen minutes a man came up and said, \\\"if they haven't called back by now, we probably don't have it.\\\" Probably?

       "      <td>Gordon Ramsay's hamburger restaurant belongs in Vegas. It's a showy affair, with some unexpected surprises and also some gambles that don't pay totally pay off. Much of the personality of this restaurant comes from the TV celebrity chef's personality, and they know it. Ramsay is staring at you from every surface and hangs over the dining room like a potentially not so benevolent overlord. It's a version of upscale cuisine for the masses of food television watchers rather than true food lovers. But watching a spectacle can still be fun if you give in and go with the show.\\n\\nWe had a group of nine, so we knew there would be a wait. We went at noon on a Saturday, and the wait was about an hour, but they will text you when your seat is ready, so we were able to walk around the casino for awhile while we waited. \\n\\nWe had still had drinks from our walk when our table was ready, and they allowed us to bring those in and offered to return the glasses to housekeeping (we were staying at the hotel) instead of us having to carry them back, so that was nice. The service was impeccable, with tons of servers and support crew so that glasses were always full, someone was always clearing our table or bringing us something, or smiling at us from their Gordan Ramsay monogrammed uniform. The jeans the men wear actually have his logo on the butts, so Ramsay truly is a marketing every aspect. \\n\\nWe started with the jalape\\u00f1o poppers. The menu promised a \\\"fiery surprise,\\\" and we were a little worried about what it might be. Turns out they leave all the seeds in one of the jalape\\u00f1os, so one of them is extra spicy. You just have no idea which one it is. Of course, the person in our group who can't really handle spicy got it, and we got the pleasure of watching his face turn red. We also ordered the sweet potato fries and the Parmesan truffle fries for the table to share. The sweet potato fries are a little too sweet, once they're dusted with vanilla powdered sugar. It becomes a dessert because there's no balance flavor of spice or tang to counter the sweet. It's the burger joint french fry version of sweet potato casserole with marshmallows. The Parmesan truffle fries were good, but I'm spoiled by having tasted truly great versions of truffle fries. I wasn't blown away. The fries are thick cut, so they don't have any crunch. There is a lot more Parmesan than truffle flavor, with soft, mild parm sprinkled like a thick blanket all over the fries. They both come with some special sauces, and I remember one was an herb aioli, but they were literally not very memorable over all.\\n\\nI ordered the farm burger and a blood orange cosmo for lunch. The farm burger is topped with duck breast bacon and a fried egg. The flavors are good, and the ingredients seem fairly high quality. The duck bacon was good, and not too, too fatty as duck sometimes can be. It still doesn't get very crispy. The flavor kind of melts in your mouth, with a pleasant amount of fatty feeling. It does that without being too greasy or overwhelming, even with a thick layer of bacon strips. The egg was cooked a little too long and the yolk wasn't runny at all. It all stayed in perfect stacks as I ate through the burger, never once turning into the messy, runny affair a fried egg burger can be. It was good, but part of the fun is the messy, runny yolk that would normally make a rich sauce over the burger. \\n\\nEveryone in my party was pleased with our meal. The hot dogs were massive, the soba noodles featured a spicy chicken side. One thing I appreciate is that they don't hold back on the spicy. The other flavors featured on the menu are more about creamy and fatty meat flavors, so the spice is a nice touch, and sharpens some of the meals pleasantly. Just enjoy the show and being over the top, and you'll leave satisfied.</td>\n",

I may try them again for breakfast, but for dinner at least the QC Cafe is a solid 3 stars.
